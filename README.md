# Little Explorers - A Holiday Recommendation Website by Karen Samad

**** device image *****

Little Explorers is a user-friendly website dedicated to effortlessly browsing and recommending child-friendly holiday destinations. Searching through the recommendations is simplified with an intuitive filter mechanism. Users possess the capability to view, edit, and delete their recommendations effortlessly, while also having the convenience to contact the site's administrators for any inquiries. Furthermore, the site is fortified against malicious content through a "report a post" feature, enabling users to flag inappropriate content, which administrators can promptly review and remove as necessary.

This project is my third Milestone Project as part of the Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development.
