## Introduction

Testing is essential to ensure that the website functions properly, free from bugs, and that users can fully utilise its features before its release to the general market. This guarantees a positive user experience (UX) and encourages repeat visits from players.

Throughout the game development process, I relied on Chrome developer tools to assess page responsiveness across various screen sizes and address any encountered issues.

In troubleshooting, I utilised the console to log and monitor JavaScript code, aiding in resolving aspects of the game that did not perform as intended. All the test results detailed below are based on the [deployed site](https://little-explorers-c2ba86cc535f.herokuapp.com/).
